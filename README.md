The repo describes how to modify APKs for Zeekr OS, e.g. translating Chinese UI to English.

It includes:
- Decompiled sources of some of the original apps, e.g. `6.0.5/original/` folder has the originals from the OS version 6.0.5
- Modified apps' sources, `6.0.5/modded/` folder has the modified apps (translated to English)
- Modified APKs, `6.0.5/modded_apks/` folder has the APKs built from the modified sources
- Scripts, docs, helpers and some binaries at the root of the repo

## Installing a ready-made APK

- Find one under the deisred frimwares/OS version folder (e.g. 6.0.5/modded_apks/)
- Use `adb install -g app.apk` to install the APK (e.g. `adb install -g 6.0.5/modded_apks/com.geely.pma.settings_en.apk`)

### Ready-made APKs

| App | Version | APK | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Car Settings | 6.0.5 | 6.0.5/modded_apks/com.geely.pma.settings_en.apk | Car Settings APP Translated to English |

## Requirements

### Instalation

If you want just to pick one of the ready-made APKs:

- Engineering menu nebled in the CAR
    - ADB set to 'Peripheral'
- Android Platform Tools (ADB)

### Development

If you wish to Mod an APK decompiling, changing and recompiling it, you will need:

- Engineering menu nebled in the CAR
    - ADB set to 'Peripheral'
- Apktool
    - Install on macOS: `brew install apktool`
    - Other platforms: https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/
- Android Platform Tools (ADB)
- Android Build Tools (apksigner, zipalign)
    - macOS versions from Android SDK are provided
- Python (Optional)
- Bash
    - Git Bash on Windows
    - Terminal on macOS
 - git-lfs to be able to push large files to the repo
    - `brew install git-lfs`, `git lfs install` and `git lfs track "*.apk"` on macOS

## Moding

### Get APK from the Car

You can use the `backup.bat` on Windows or `backup.sh` on macOS to backup all the APKs from the car.

Some of the apps:
- com.android.systemui - Status bar at the top of the screen
- com.geely.pma.settings - Car Settings app

### Decompile APK

`apktool b _input/com.geely.pma.settings.apk -o 6.0.5/modded/com.geely.pma.settings_en.apk`

### Make changes

- res/values
    - Check strings.xml, arrays.xml, plurals.xml
- Pay attention to envoding special chars in XML, e.g. use \' for single quotes

### Build and sign APK

Zeekr OS is based on AOSP and uses test keys supplied by Google. I have included .JKS that is used to sign APK to ensure standard signatures are retained. This way apps can be updated inplace.

`zsh build_apk.sh -inputFolder 6.0.5/modded/com.geely.pma.settings -outputFile _output/com.geely.pma.settingsi_en.apk` (or use `sh` instead of `zsh`)

#### How it works

- **Output Directory Check**: The script ensures that the directory for the output file exists and is empty. If the directory is not empty, it halts execution to prevent overwriting existing files.

- **APK Building**: Using `apktool`, the script compiles the source files in the `inputFolder` into an APK file specified by `outputFile`. This step is crucial for creating a functional APK from modified source files.

   Command: `apktool b "$inputFolder" -o "$outputFile"`

- **APK Alignment**: The script uses `zipalign` to optimize the APK file.  Without this stage the system will not accept the APK.

   Command: `./zipalign -p 4 "$outputFile" "$alignedApk"`

- **APK Signing**: Finally, the script signs the APK using `apksigner` with a bundled ASOP keystore (androiddebugkey.jks). This step is necessary to ensure the APK can be installed on the device replacing the original one.

   Command: 
   ```
   ./apksigner sign \
     --ks "$keystorePath" \
     --ks-key-alias "$keyAlias" \
     --ks-pass pass:"$keystorePassword" \
     --key-pass pass:"$keystorePassword" \
     --out "$signedApk" \
     --v1-signing-enabled false \
     --v2-signing-enabled true \
     --v3-signing-enabled false \
     "$alignedApk"
   ```

### Install APK

`adb install -g _output/com.android.systemui_en.apk`
